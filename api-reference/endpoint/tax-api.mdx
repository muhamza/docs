title: "Sphere Tax Calculation API"
description: "This API calculates tax based on the customer's address, line item details, and currency."
---

### **<u>Prerequisites</u>**

1. A Sphere account is required. You can sign up for free at [Sphere Dashboard](https://dashboard.getsphere.com/).
2. Ensure that products are listed under the "Products" tab. **Note:** To populate the "Products" tab, you need to first connect to a billing provider in the Sphere app. This connection will automatically fetch and display the products from the billing provider.
3. Verify that each product has an assigned tax code, which is used to determine whether the product is taxable or not.\
**Note:** If the products are not configured and you pass the product IDs in the payload, the API will return a 400 Bad Request response.
4. Ensure you are registered with the relevant tax authority for the customer address you will provide, and confirm that the **tax calculation feature** is enabled in Sphere.\
**Note**: If you are not registered with a tax authority or the tax calculation feature is disabled, the API will return empty tax_amounts arrays for line items. (See Response Payload below)
